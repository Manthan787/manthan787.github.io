Hitch is a cross-platform version of AirDrop. It allows easy file-transfer among devices in the same network, just like AirDrop. Underneath, it uses ZeroConf to discover all the hitch-enabled devices.

Here's how simple sending a file using Hitch is:

## Story

The inspiration for this project came from the need of AirDrop like easy file transfer app for all platforms (windows, linux, mac e.g.).

Initially, the app was built using Python only because how simple it is to do network programming in Python. But eventually, I decided to rewrite the app in Javascript using the Electron framework for better UI.
